            The fall of 2020 has not been easy on anyone. As the world grapples to maintain a sense of normality amidst
            the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been made clear that no one will escape this year unaffected. Students and
            universities are no exception. This fall, Kansas State University’s enrollment numbers are down nearly 4%.
            Across all of its campuses, the university is teaching 865 less students, as stated in the preliminary
            Kansas Board of Regents campus statistics report, making this semester the lowest in terms of enrollment
            since 1998. Although the pandemic has accelerated the issue, the coronavirus is not to blame for the past 10
            years of a steady decline in students choosing to attend the university. After analyzing the university’s
            enrollment data from years past, interviewing K-State’s enrollment professionals and speaking with both
            students who returned to K-State this semester and others who chose to take time off, it is clear there are
            many factors at play when students decide where to invest in their college education.

    <h3>14% Decline Within The Last 5 Years</h3>

    <div class="main-text">
        <p>
            Looking back over K-State’s last ten years, the university has had its ups and downs in terms of attendance.
            The fall of 2014 saw the highest number in K-State history, with 24,766 students enrolled. Within the last
            five years, the total enrollment has declined nearly 14%, the largest decline in any state university in
            Kansas.

    <h3>Impact of COVID-19</h3>

    <div class="main-text">
        <p>
            Surveying the data, it can be observed that COVID-19 cannot be held totally responsible for the decline in
            K-State’s enrollment, however the pandemic has done some considerable damage. Lauren Schath was a junior at
            K-State last semester who had fully intended on returning to Manhattan in the fall to finish out her senior
            year and graduate with a degree in elementary education. However, everything changed once COVID-19 struck
            the united states in the early spring of this year. With many classes only offered online and all of the
            uncertainties about when life will return to a state of normalcy, Schath made the tough decision to not
            return to K-State this semester.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="main-text">
        <p>
            “I did not want to pay all that money for an education when I did not feel I was getting everything I could
            out of it,” Schath said. She explained that she did not take this decision lightly, but that on her time
            spent at home she has been able to earn some money while working as a para at an elementary school in her
            hometown- a job that she says she has loved. She looks forward to her plans of returning to K-State next
            August.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="main-text">
        <p>
            For students who chose to return to K-State, this semester has been unlike any other. Senior in dietetics,
            Jordyn Granger, decided to reenroll at K-State this semester in order to keep her job in Manhattan and to
            stay on track for graduation in May. Despite her excitement to return to K-State, she says this school year
            has not been easy.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="main-text">
        <p>
            “School is online, and I have zero motivation,” Granger said. “I feel like I’m not getting the education I
            got in past semesters because I was more engaged in-person. I feel like I have to teach myself.” Granger
            said that if given the chance to go back and redecide whether to attend K-State this semester or not, she
            “probably would’ve taken time off to spend time with family and to work.”
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="main-text">
        <p>
            Given the circumstances, it is no wonder that so many students have chosen to sit this semester out from
            college, but unfortunately the lack of tuition funding is being felt within the university.
        </p>

    <h3>Effects of Enrollment Decrease</h3>

    <div class="main-text">
        <p>
            This year, 40% of K-State’s budget plan was expected to come from tuition. The remaining 60% was generated
            from alternative means, a major contributor included funding from the state. However, within the last 10
            years, Kansas has reduced this funding significantly. According to Ethan Erickson, K-State’s Chief Financial
            Officer and Director of Budget Planning, the university has had to reduce this year’s budget dramatically to
            accommodate for funding
            fluctuations due to state cuts and COVID-19, forcing the university to make difficult decisions.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="main-text">
        <p>
            “Eighty-eight percent of our budget is tied up in people,” Erickson said, “and so when you reduce the
            budget, you have got to reduce your personnel salaries as well. That’s the really big impact that happens
            when both enrollment and state funding go down.”
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="main-text">
        <p>
            Although the university is looking for alternative ways to cut the budget, such as eliminating travel
            expenses during the pandemic, letting faculty go has unfortunately had to become a reality. Erickson said
            that he can’t think of a department at K-State that hasn’t been impacted by these budget cuts in some
            fashion. The graph below outlines the decline in K-State enrollment, broken down by college.</p>

            Looking at years to come, K-State, along with the rest of the world, is hopeful for a soon end to the
            pandemic that has done so much damage.

            “The real pessimistic side of me would say, we’ll never look like we did pre-COVID,” Erickson said, speaking
            about the K-State budget.

            However, looking at past numbers, it’s clear that K-State is going to have to correct pre-existing issues if
            the university wants to see a rise in enrollment. According to Erickson, the pandemic may have created a
            steeper decline in enrollment numbers at K-State, but it was just accelerating trends the university has
            been seeing for the past 10 years.

        <h4>Data collection and data analysis</h4>
        <p>This data was collected from <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/registrar/statistics/colleges.html"> K-State's
                website</a>. The data was then analyzed in a google spreadsheet, where
            it was cleaned. I also spoke with Dr. Bin Ning, the Associate Provost of Institutional Research at K-State
            who provided the enrollment numbers for 2020. I cross checked these numbers with K-State’s Office of the
            Registrar to ensure they were correct. Additional sources include the Collegian's article, <a
                href="https://www.kstatecollegian.com/2020/10/01/k-states-overall-enrollment-falls-4-1-percent-in-fall-2020/">K-State’s
                overall enrollment falls 4.1 percent in fall 2020</a>, and interviews with Ethan Erickson, Jordyn
            Granger and Lauren Schath. </p>
